# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for-Financial-Data

In this jupyter notebook, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on Financial data.

I have used stocks data of a company (named any XYZ) which contains the opening, closing, high and low stock prices per day.

The data is also available in the repository.

Also performed data filtering and built some visualizations from the dataset.
